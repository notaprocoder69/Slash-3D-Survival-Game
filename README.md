## Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- JavaScript enabled
- Recommended browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (with Hardware Acceleration enabled)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notaprocoder69/Slash-3D-Survival-Game.git
```

2. Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd Slash-3D-Survival-Game
```

3. Serve the project using a local web server
   - Recommended: Use `live-server` or Python's `http.server`

## Running the Game
- Open `index.html` in a web browser
- Ensure all resource paths are correctly configured

## Resource Dependencies
- External Three.js library (CDN)
- Custom model resources in `./resources/` directory
  - Characters
  - Weapons
  - Environment models

## Gameplay Controls
- Movement: WASD keys
- Camera: Mouse movement
- Attack: Space Bar
- Inventory management: Drag n Drop

## Performance Optimization
